## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to build a regression model to predict house prices using a given dataset. The evaluation criteria will be based on your feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model accuracy, and deployment of the model both locally and on the Render cloud platform.

## Dataset

I will use the "House Prices" dataset, which contains various features of houses and their corresponding prices. You can download the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/housing-dataset](#).
